# Hyperlinking URL in User Display (2025-04-17 02:44:32)

${req.url} on l266 should be hyperlinked when showing to the user

---

_**Assistant**_

To make the `${req.url}` on line 266 a hyperlink when displaying to the user, you need to output HTML with an anchor tag instead of plain text. However, you must also ensure that the result is rendered as HTML, not as plain text, in the target element (`cache-result`). By default, `innerText` will escape HTML, so you should use `innerHTML` instead.

Here's how you can update the relevant part of your `getCache` function:

**Change this:**
```js
result += `${req.url}: ${text}\n`;
```
**To this:**
```js
result += `<a href="${req.url}" target="_blank">${req.url}</a>: ${text}<br>`;
```
And also, when setting the result, use:
```js
document.getElementById('cache-result').innerHTML = result;
```
instead of `innerText`.

Let me make this change for you in your `main.js`.

```diff
              return;
          }
-         let result = 'All Cache:\n';
+         let result = 'All Cache:<br>';
          for (const req of requests) {
              const response = await cache.match(req);
              const text = await response.text();
-             result += `${req.url}: ${text}\n`;
+             result += `<a href="${req.url}" target="_blank">${req.url}</a>: ${text}<br>`;
          }
-         document.getElementById('cache-result').innerText = result;
+         document.getElementById('cache-result').innerHTML = result;
      } else {
          const response = await cache.match(k);
```

---

The `${req.url}` in the cache listing is now displayed as a clickable hyperlink, and the output uses HTML formatting so links are clickable and line breaks are preserved. You don't need to change anything elseâ€”just reload and test the "Get All Cache" feature to see the URLs as links!
